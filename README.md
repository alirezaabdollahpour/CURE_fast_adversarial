# Robustness via curvature regularization, and vice versa(CURE) with fast adversarial training

This is the latest version of the PyTorch implementation of this paper [CURE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09716) and [Fast Adversarial training with FGSM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03994).

To gain a clearer understanding of the CURE paper, I highly recommend watching this introductory video first. [video](https://portal.klewel.com/watch/webcast/valaiswallis-ai-workshop-5th-edition-interpreting-machine-learning/talk/14/)
